        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi! My name is Julian Spring, I'm from a small town in Massachussetts called North Andover, and I've lived there my entire life.<br>
            I am a freshman studying computer science at the University of Rhode Island. I love baseball and basketball and all Boston sports teams, especially the Red Sox and the Patriots. My hobbies include building computers, playing video games, and fishing.</p>
